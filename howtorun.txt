To compile the project:
    bash ./compile.sh
To link
    bash ./link.sh

## NEW WAY ##
Run this to compile and link the program using the Makefile
    make

If a change has been done to the code but make does not see the change,
run 
    make clean


Open debugging port on localhost:4242 (by default)
    st-util         ; The ST-LINK device has to be plugged in

## NEW WAY ##
If we don't need to be debugging, we can run
    st-flash write main.bin 0x08000000
        or
    st-flash --connect-under-reset write main.bin 0x08000000

Then run the debugger on main.elf (default name) in a different terminal
    arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf (arm-none-eabi-gdb is a softlink for /usr/bin/gdb-multiarch)

Connect the debugger to the chip
    target extended-remote :4242

Finally load the program
    load

The program might be paused because of the debugger, so
you have to call:
    continue
so that the program continues to run as normal
